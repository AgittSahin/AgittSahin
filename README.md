## 👋 Hey, I'm Agit

I'm teaching myself AI from scratch — one model, one mistake, and one insight at a time.

📍 Final-year Software Engineering student in Berlin  
⚙️ Learning in public: math, forecasting, systems, deployment  
🧠 Focused on building real-world intelligence, not just demos  
✍️ I write about everything I break and rebuild → [Medium](https://medium.com/@agitsahin)
